Migrant workers:

In the crisis situation the most impacted community is the labor or daily wagers. In this pandemic COVID-19, the migrant worker faces the most challenging phase for their existence as they completely alienated from society as they are away from their native places and the loved once.

An app-based platform to provide real-time information based on Speech, voice & text in local/ regional native language.

We have identified a few problem statements to develop the application related to newly emerged Migrant worker challenges faced by India. 

Problem Statement:
> Low literacy rate, Understand the local or regional language
> Skilled or unskilled workers
> Dependant on daily wages
> Communication delay (in-real time) - Lack of information related to government schemes and food and shelter.
> Hygiene and sanitation issues
> Dependant family members
> Fear for COVID-19 infection
> Living in a high-density area (eg. Dharavi slum in Mumbai).
> Dependent on public transport no private commute facility
> Believes in cash transactions only (no use of plastic money or digital money apps).

Proposed Solution:
> A user can record his information and prospects through speech.
> Translate information in local/ regional language.
> Pop-ups are related to news respect to COVID-19 & Migrant Workers.
> job posting
> Skill training
> A platform to connect with their dependants living in a remote location


An informed citizen during crisis is more resilient. During the crisis, they need support from the government & society. 

The Migrant workers are the nation builders and they mostly work under un-organized sectors.

Through this web or android application, we propose a one-stop solution where they can enroll themself, newsfeed & information from the government directly received. At most important to create a job market where they can be hired as per their skill and ability.

This application more focus to provide employment close to their home in their own native state or a nearby state. 

This application looks more worthy when we think about our diverse country and society where we have 22 official languages and innumerable dialects.
